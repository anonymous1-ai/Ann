# How to Add Your Own Logo - Quick Guide

## The Problem Was Fixed!
The logo system is now working correctly. The application now uses the configuration system I created.

## To Add Your Logo (2 Simple Steps):

### Step 1: Add Your Logo File
- Drop your logo file into this `client/src/assets/` folder
- Supported formats: PNG, JPG, SVG, WebP
- Name it anything you want (e.g., `my-logo.png`, `company-logo.svg`)

### Step 2: Update the Configuration
Open `logo-config.ts` in this same folder and change these two lines:

```typescript
// Change this from false to true:
export const USE_CUSTOM_LOGO = true;

// Update this path to match your file name:
export const CUSTOM_LOGO_PATH = '/src/assets/my-logo.png';
```

## Example
If you add a file called `awesome-logo.png`:

```typescript
export const USE_CUSTOM_LOGO = true;
export const CUSTOM_LOGO_PATH = '/src/assets/awesome-logo.png';
```

## What Happens
Your logo will instantly replace the current logo in:
- Navigation bar (all pages)
- Login and signup forms
- Loading screen
- Footer areas

## Logo Recommendations
- **Size**: 512x512px or larger
- **Format**: PNG with transparent background (best)
- **Colors**: Should work well with gold theme
- **Aspect**: Square preferred, but rectangles work too

That's it! The system is now fully connected and working.
